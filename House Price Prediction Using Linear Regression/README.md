# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Description

This Python project predicts house prices based on various features using **Linear Regression**. The project involves data loading, exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It compares the performance of the trained model with a baseline model that predicts the average house price.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Exploration:** The dataset is explored for missing values and correlation between features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** New features are created to help the model make better predictions.
3. **Model Training:** A Linear Regression model is trained on the data to predict house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and the performance is compared with a baseline model.
