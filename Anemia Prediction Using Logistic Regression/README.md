# Anemia Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Description

This Python project predicts the presence of anemia based on health parameters like Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and MCHC using Logistic Regression. The project includes data loading, exploration, model training, and evaluation. The dataset is analyzed to explore correlations, and a Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the binary outcome (anemic or not).

## Requirements

The required libraries are:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Dataset
The project uses an anemia dataset (anemia.csv) that contains health data and an outcome column (Result) indicating whether the patient is anemic (1) or not (0).



To run this project, you'll need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
