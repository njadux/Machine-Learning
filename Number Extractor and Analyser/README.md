# Phone Number Extractor and Analyzer

## Description

This Python project uses regular expressions (regex) to extract, analyze, and manipulate phone numbers and other text-based elements from user input. The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Phone Number Extraction:** It identifies and extracts phone numbers in the `XXX-XXX-XXXX` format.
2. **Word Extraction:** The input is split into words, and the longest word is identified.
3. **Digit Extraction:** All occurrences of one or more digits are found, and the longest numerical sequence is printed.

This project showcases basic text parsing techniques using Python's `re` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses Python's built-in `re` module)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python phone_number_extractor.py
