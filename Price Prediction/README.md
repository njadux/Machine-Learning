# Multiple Variable Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

## Description

This project uses **multiple variable linear regression** to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. The model is built using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, with a custom implementation of the cost function and gradient descent for optimization.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Exploration:** Load and explore the dataset, handle missing values, and visualize relationships between features.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Building:** Train a multiple variable linear regression model to predict house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using the cost function and visualize the results.

Dataset
This project uses a dataset of house prices with multiple features (e.g., size, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) for training the linear regression model. The dataset file is kc_final.csv.
